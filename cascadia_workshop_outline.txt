introductions

teaser - building bots with bots

our robot fabricator: fused deposition modeler (reprap [makerbot fork])
our software: parametric solid modeler (freecad [solidworksish clone])
our project: ring

*** parametric solid modeler lets us create a series of 2d sketches showing
    constraints to generate 3d geometry
- ring constraints
- fdm constraints

*** ring demo

*** slicing & makerbot

*** other fabrication technologies
- subtractive
 * 2d
  > laser cutter (circuit board laser!)
  > water jet cutter
  > plasma cutter
 * 3d
  > cnc router/mill
- additive
 * 2d
  > xy ink jet
 * 3d
  > bind pool of material
    # stereolithography (uv cure resin)
    # inkjet & powder
    # laser sintering (eos printer -> spacex engine) (sls nylon)
    # electron beam melting (titanium!)
  > extrude material
    # fdm (multimaterial fdm)
    # wax
    # ceramic
    # concrete
  > place & bind
    # polyjet inkjet & uv-cure
    # electron beam freeform fabrication (wire welder in vacuum)
- assembly
  > pick & place
- modular robotics
  
*** other cad technologies
- mesh modeling (sketchup)
- nurbs animation (maya & blender)
- solid modeling (boolean) (openscad)
- parametric solid modeling (with history) (solidworks, catia, inventor)
- cam (pro-engineer, fusion 360, meshmixer)
- finite element analysis
- printed circuit board design (kicad, upverter, altium)

*** my research
- posey
- prismatic cubes

*** example robots & mechanisms
- bike brake light
- tetradie
- kossel
- making things interactive
  * projects
    > finite state machines
    > musical instruments
    > chair sensors & visualization (bush school)
  * final projects
    > touchless cupboard
    > weight sensing bag

*** brainstorming pedagogical applications
