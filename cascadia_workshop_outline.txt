introductions

teaser - building bots with bots

our robot fabricator: fused deposition modeler (reprap [makerbot fork])
our software: parametric solid modeler (freecad [solidworksish clone])
our project: ring

*** parametric solid modeler lets us create a series of 2d sketches showing
    constraints to generate 3d geometry
- ring constraints
- fdm constraints
